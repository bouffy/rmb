            <strong>THE RIGHT CANDIDATE FOR YOUR ROLE.</strong>
          </div>
          <p>Executing an effective and efficient search is a challenge. From developing a clear mandate for the role, to attracting the right candidates and "closing the deal," each touchpoint is essential.</p>
          <p>Having managed both lateral recruiting and recruitment marketing for a top law firm, I know first-hand how best to add value to your search. I partner with recruiters to obtain a nuanced understanding of the substantive experience, academic background and cultural values required of each candidate, and I present only the most qualified lawyers for each role.</p>

            <strong>THE RMB DIFFERENCE</strong>
          </div>
          <br/>
          <span class="subheading">The right experience.</span>
          <p> I am one of very few lateral recruiters with experience as a senior member of a top law firm's recruiting team. My in-house recruiting background allows me to effectively assess candidates' qualifications and fit, removing unnecessary and time-consuming resume culling from your to-do list.</p>
          <br/> 
          <span class="subheading">Ahead of the market.</span>
          <p>My experience as a former practicing attorney, in-house recruiter and legal marketing professional has equipped me with an understanding of the dynamic legal market. I keep informed of macro and micro developments, including lateral hiring trends and high-impact partner and group moves, and actively share that knowledge with you to assist in the development of your hiring strategy.</p>
          <br/>
          <span class="subheading">Customized positioning for your firm.</span>
          <p>Ensuring that your target candidate understands your firm—its culture, values, organizational structure and more—is an essential component of the placement process. I leverage my experience developing strategic marketing initiatives for both law firm candidates and clients to ensure that each employer's value proposition is communicated effectively.</p>
          <br/>
          <span class="subheading">Access to the best talent.</span>
          <br/>
          <p>Many of the most qualified lawyers aren't actively looking for new roles, and are weary of the seemingly endless barrage of cold calls they receive. I rely on strategic, sophisticated sourcing techniques—as well as my personal and professional networks—to give you access to both active and passive elite talent (<a href="about.html">learn more about my background</a>).</p>
